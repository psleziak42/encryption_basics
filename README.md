# encryption_basics

1. History
  1.1 Very Beginning, what is what:
  - Steganography - how to hide the message in the message
  - Cryptography
  - Cryptoanalisis
  1.2 Ciphres along the history:
  - Cesar Cipher
  - Homofonic Cipher
  - Polialfabetic Cipher
  - Diagraphic
  1.3 Modern Era
  - DES
  - Asymetric Criptography - no more problem with key distribution, Diffie-Helman
    - RSA
      - explain public/private key
      - public - to encrypt, private to decrypt, but private also to decrypt and public to encrypt to provide authenticiy (digital sign) of           the owner of the key.

2. Mathematical basics of crypto
  - present how the RSA public and private key work from mathematical pov. Only this one because its prety complicated

3. Threats
  3.1 Cryptoanalisis attacks:
    - brute-force
    - ciphertext-only
    - known-plaintext 
    - chosen-plaintext
    - chosen-ciphertext
    - adaptive-chosen-plaintext
   3.2 H4Ck3rm4n:
    - Dos
    - Side Channel
    - Bday attack
    - Man in the Middle
    - Meet in the Middle
    - few others if its not too long
    - Social engineering
     
4. Encryption Theory
  4.1. Types and tribes of cyphers
    - Block ciphres
    - Stream ciphers
   4.2. Cryptographic Protocols
    - key exchange
    - digital signature
   4.3. Optonal: quantum computers and physics in encryption
   
5. Crypto in Practice:
  -TLS/SSH
  - the weakest link - how the best system is hopeless if you use if wrong!

Explain that:
- hashing
- encrypthing
They go together :)
